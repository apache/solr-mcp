     * Sanitizes field names to ensure they are compatible with Solr's field naming requirements.

     * <p><strong>Sanitization Rules:</strong>
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li><strong>Case Conversion</strong>: All characters converted to lowercase
     *   <li><strong>Character Replacement</strong>: Non-alphanumeric characters replaced with
     *       underscores
     *   <li><strong>Edge Trimming</strong>: Leading and trailing underscores removed
     *   <li><strong>Duplicate Compression</strong>: Multiple consecutive underscores collapsed to
     *       single
     *   <li><strong>Numeric Prefix</strong>: Field names starting with numbers get "field_" prefix
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p><strong>Example Transformations:</strong>
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>"User-Name" → "user_name"
     *   <li>"product.price" → "product_price"
     *   <li>"__field__name__" → "field_name"
     *   <li>"Field123@Test" → "field123_test"
     *   <li>"123field" → "field_123field"
     * </ul>

     * null/empty
